Ada for Salesforce is an open source solution for using Cardano Network to collect payments into Salesforce. Web3 Enablerâ€™s [Blockchain Payments](https://web3enabler.com/product/blockchain-payments) supports UTXO models as well as Account models, so we have the experience and core tools to bring over to Ada for Salesforce. Ada for Salesforce monitors the blockchain, so it  should work with any popular Cardano wallet users want to use.
